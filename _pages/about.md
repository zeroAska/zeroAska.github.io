I'm currently a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.tri.global/">Toyota Research Institute</a>, where I develop realtime perception algorithms for autonomous robots. My research interest lies in the theory and applications of robot perception, computer vision, and geometric deep learning methods. 

Previously, I completed my Robotics PhD at <a href="https://curly.engin.umich.edu">Computational Autonomy and Robotics Laboratory (CURLY)</a> and the <a href="http://robots.engin.umich.edu">Perceptual Robotics Laboratory (PeRL)</a> at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, adviced by <a href="https://name.engin.umich.edu/people/ghaffari-maani/">Professor Maani Ghaffari</a> and <a href="http://robots.engin.umich.edu/~ryan/">Professor Ryan Eustice</a>. I also had collabrations with <a href="https://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/">Professor Jessy Grizzle</a> and research internships at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lab126">Amazon Lab126</a> and <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">Mathworks</a>. Additionally, I served as a student investor in the space of Robotics/AI at <a href="https://zli.umich.edu/wolverine-venture-fund">Wolverine Venture Fund</a>.
